# MirrorRayPath
Simple visualization of propagation of rays reflected from a mirror

Now includes python scripts for the following cases:
- A spherical mirror and a collimated beam. There the mirror curvature radius, angle of the collimated beam and number of rays can be changed
- A sphreical mirror and a beam of a point source. There the mirror curvature radius, point source position, amplitude angle of the beam divergence and number of rays can be changed
